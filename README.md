# Accessibility Is Groovy

## Description

The purpose of this project was to improve the existing websites accessibility features by implementing semantic HTML tags, adding alt descriptions to images, and ensuring the HTML code followed a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. This was doen to optimize the site for search engines. The applications CSS was improved by consolidating selectors and combining elements that share the same styling in order to avoid repeating code that might slow the site rendering down.
